# Hello-World-App
Objective: The goal of this assessment is to set up a basic React project and render a simple "Hello World" message in the web browser. This will test your ability to initialize a React project and understand fundamental React concepts.
Setting Up the React App Initialize a new React project using Vite or Create React App (CRA). Ensure the project structure follows best practices.
Rendering "Hello World" Modify the main component (e.g., App.js or App.jsx) to display the text "Hello World" in the browser. Use JSX syntax to structure the content properly.
Requirements: Use React 18+ (preferably with functional components). Ensure the project runs without errors. Use semantic HTML (e.g.. `<h1>` for the "Hello World" message).
